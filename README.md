NEXT WORD PREDICTION USING DEEP LEARNING [PYTHON]

- The Next Word Prediction project using deep learning involves developing a model that predicts the subsequent word in a given sequence of text. It predicts 3 probable next words for a given input text.
-  Utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with TensorFlow and Keras, the model is trained on large textual datasets to understand context and syntax.
-  The preprocessing of data includes tokenization, lowercasing, removing punctuations and special characters, removing stopwords, word stemmings and padding to standardize input lengths, enhancing model performance.
-  This predictive capability significantly improves user experience in applications like text editors and chatbots by providing accurate real-time word suggestions based on the input words.
